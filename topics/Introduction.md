Welcome to the official documentation for the Atlas bot. Here youâ€™ll learn all about Atlas and its awesome features and capabilities! Atlas is an advanced Discord bot, but with a little coaching and a healthy dose of ambition, anyone can master it. We've tried to make everything as easy as possible to follow, so just sit back, relax, and let us do the explaining!

If you've never used Atlas before, a good place to start would be our [Getting Started](/documentation/tutorials/Getting_Started) guide.

## Atlas Resources

Atlas has a lot of stuff going on. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with the Joneses. Here is a list of comprehensive resources to keep you in the loop!

- [Support Server](https://atlasbot.xyz/support)

Sometimes a tutorial just doesn't help, sometimes you need one-on-one help. Maybe you need help creating a custom action tailored to your specific needs or maybe you just can't quite figure out how to set command restrictions. Luckily, we have a dedicated support team ready to assist you with anything Atlas. Also get notified of Atlas' latest and greatest features through our changelogs channel.

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8Otuk5R1)

On our Trello, we keep track of reported bugs, future plans, and user-suggested improvements for Atlas. Need to report a bug? Visit our [support server](https://atlasbot.xyz/support) and drop a line in the bug reports channel. We'll try our best to find it and squash it as soon as possible.

- [Community Actions Repository](https://github.com/doddsy/atlas-custom-actions)

Actions are Atlas' crown jewel, and for good reason! Check out what some of our most experienced users have made with actions, and import them into your guild with ease! Although this repository is not an official Atlas resource _(yet)_, it is curated by our own Atlas support team.
