Plugins are what makes Atlas so hot and spicy! This is a brief introduction to each plugin currently available. Here, you’ll learn what they do and how you can use them.

## Actions

The actions plugin is the pièce de résistance of Atlas; think custom commands… on Russian steroids. With over 100 specialized tags, the only limit to creating your very own action is your imagination! Just check out [what other people have made](https://github.com/doddsy/atlas-custom-actions) with actions!

## Fun

Isn’t this kind of self-explanatory? The fun plugin houses a whole slew of exciting and entertaining commands. Need to flip a coin on a college student’s budget? Lucky for you, we’ve got a coin flip command. Want some facts about cats? We’ve got those too. Ask the 8-ball a burning question, generate some dank memes, get some classic dad-jokes to fill that void in your life, and much more.

## Gatekeeper

All hail! The gatekeeper is in charge of all users who dare enter your realm. Enable fully customizable join messages or leave messages that support [tags](https://atlasbot.xyz/documentation/tags).

## Images

Your very own meme generator! Who hasn’t ever wanted that?! Impress all your friends by creating high-quality memes on the spot, no watermarks included!

## Info 

General help centre, responsible for commands like `a!help` - the general help command that can provide additional information and usage for any command Atlas has - and `a!ping` - the command used to check if Atlas is online and the millisecond delay between Atlas and your server.

## Levels

The levels plugin allows you create a balanced tier reward system for the most active members of your server. Create level rewards for achieving specified levels, customize level-up messages, and view your server’s very own leaderboard.

## Moderation

Whip those pesky troublemakers into shape with the raw might of the moderation plugin! Set customized chat filters for things like links, cursing, mass-mentions, and more. We also have a helpful action log that keeps an eye on everything that you can’t. Easy-to-use commands simplify the moderation process; ban, kick, mute, and warn with ease!

## Music

Ever wanted to listen to your favourite music while chatting with friends? Well, this plugin is for you. From playing any song of your choice to rick-rolling your friends, the music plugin has it all. *Psst, wanna play a song from your spotify playlist?* Good news, If you're a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/NotSylver) supporter, Atlas can do that too!

## Roles

Anything roles related is located here. Easily assign `Join Roles`, `Reaction Roles`, and `I Am Roles`. Manage your server's roles and get more information about them straight from any text channel.

## Tickets 

Allow members to easily create private channels to have one-on-one conversations with your server's staff team.

## Utilities

The most useful commands of all usefulness. Create sexy embeds to your heart's desire; search terms on Google; get information about your favourite games, shows, minecraft servers, and movies; strip spoilers from any message; or learn all about what SpaceX is up to and more!
