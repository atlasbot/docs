Everybody needs to start somewhere. Here you'll learn how to invite and control Atlas in your guild. You'll also learn how to use commands and access the dashboard.

## What is Atlas?

Atlas is a sleek, modern Discord bot with capabilities such as powerful server moderation, crystal-clear music, extremely extensive and advanced custom commands, an easy-to-use ticketing system, a customizable leveling system, and much more!

Sound good so far? Excellent! Let’s invite Atlas to your server so you can start reaping the benefits.

## Invite Atlas

To use Atlas, first you have to invite it to your server. You can do so by [clicking here](https://atlasbot.xyz/get), but do keep in mind, you must have at least **Manage Server** permissions to invite Atlas to a server. If you have the proper permissions, select your server from the drop-down menu then click `Authorize`. Discord may think you are a spoopy robot so complete the captcha if it prompts you to. It will redirect you to a confirmation screen if it was successful. Hooray! Atlas will now show up as a member in your server, meaning it’s been successfully invited.

## Controlling Atlas

### Running Commands

Atlas can be controlled by using chat commands executed directly from Discord. By default you can trigger Atlas by pinging Atlas `@Atlas` or by typing `a!` followed by an adjacent command. Lets try that now. First make sure Atlas has permissions to view and send messages in the channel you wish, next type `a!help` in Discord and press send. Huzzah! Atlas will obediently listen to your request and show you a complete list of executable commands. The power of Atlas is yours to command!

### Accessing the Web Dashboard

Not all aspects of Atlas, such as configuring actions or reaction roles, can be controlled by chat commands. This is why we have an intuitive web-based dashboard. To access the dashboard for your server [click here](https://atlasbot.xyz) and manually login or simply type `a!dashboard` in your Discord server.
