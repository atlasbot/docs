Discord may ask you to complete a captcha to prove you are a human, then it will show a confirmation screen if it was successful. Atlas will now show up as a member in your server, meaning you've successfully invited Atlas.\n\n\nRunning Commands\n\n\nAtlas is mainly controlled by user-operated text commands sent though your server's chat. By default, Atlas' command prefix is \na!\n, so to execute a command type \na!<command name>\n, without the arrows \n< >\n. For example, to get a list of all commands, type \na!help\n and Atlas will direct-message you a list of commands.\n\n\nAccessing the Dashboard\n\n\nSome features of Atlas, such as \nactions\n, cannot be configured via commands. This is why Atlas has a web dashboard to fine-tune control of your server.
