You can create custom commands to explain things to users without having to type multiple paragraphs every time someone asks or copy/paste the response. You could also use them in many other creative ways, like force users to agree to a TOS by using the {addrole} variable which gives them a role with more permissions, then restrict access to only the agree channel when they join.\n\n\nCreating Commands\n\n\nBefore creating your own commands, you'll have to go to your servers dashboard. Go \nhere\n and sign in, then select your server from the dropdown at the top right. Go to the Custom Commands module on your right. This is where you can control commands by creating, modifying, deleting or disabling them.\n\n\nAfter that, you can click the \nNew Command\n button which will bring up a modal showing you options for your new command. Commands must have a name and response, everything else is optional. Command names cannot have spaces, so keep that in mind.\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nYou can create dynamic custom commands using variables. Variables are like placeholders for data that Atlas will fill in, though that isn't all they can do.\n\n\nYou can see most variables on your left under \"Variables\".",
