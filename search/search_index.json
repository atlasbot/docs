This resource site is here to help you learn how to use Atlas and all of it's awesome features! We've tried to make everything as easy as possible to follow, so just sit back, relax, and let us do the explaining! If you've never used Atlas before, you should probably take a look at our quick start guide. Note Atlas version 8 is a brand spankin' new update to the Atlas bot - that means that the documentation or information found within may be incomplete or somewhat unclear. Please give us some time to fix these mistakes. Open Source If you're too impatient to wait for us to fix it or if you found something we missed, then lucky for you, this documentation is open source! Just head on over to our GitHub repository to suggest a revision. Community Actions Some members of the community have made a repository of custom commands that everyone is free to use and add to! You can check it out by clicking here. Warning This repository is recognised by the Atlas staff but does not officially belong to them (however it is run by some support staff). While every attempt is made to test commands and remove malicious material, moderation is not always possible. Use caution when using anything taken from this repository. Need Help? Have you read through the documentation and still can't figure out what's wrong? Luckily, we have a dedicated support server to assist you. Keep in mind, though, that our support staff are real humans that may not be able to help to you instantly - that said, we'll try our best.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"Welcome to the official documentation for Atlas Version 8 .

Here is probably the best place to start! Invite Atlas For Atlas to work in your server, you have to invite it. You can do so by clicking here . Next, select your server from the drop-down menu and click Authorize . Discord may ask you to complete a captcha to prove you are a human, then it will show a confirmation screen if it was successful. Atlas will now show up as a member in your server, meaning you've successfully invited Atlas. Running Commands Atlas is mainly controlled by user-operated text commands sent though your server's chat. By default, Atlas' command prefix is a! , so to execute a command type a!<command name> , without the arrows < > . For example, to get a list of all commands, type a!help and Atlas will direct-message you a list of commands. Accessing the Dashboard Some features of Atlas, such as actions , cannot be configured via commands. This is why Atlas has a web dashboard to fine-tune control of your server. You can access the dashboard for your server by using the a!dashboard command in your server, or by clicking here and logging in manually. Note You must be the server owner or have at least Manage Server permissions to access a server's dashboard. If you do not meet one of these criteria, you will not be able to access or edit the dashboard!","title":"Quick Start Guide"},{"location":"quick_start/#quick-start-guide","text":"New to using Atlas?

Actions allow you to do something every x minutes, or create a custom command, or a do a ton of other things relatively easily. Triggers Each action has a trigger. Triggers can be things like adding a certain emoji to a message or running a command. Trigger Types Command Triggers when someone has a message with a prefix and label matching the server's prefix and action content. Keyword Triggers when a message is created including the trigger content. Interval Triggers at a configurable interval. Whoever last updated the action will be the user in context. All command tags and their commands will run on behalf of this user. Message Reaction Add Triggers when the trigger content is added to a message as a reaction. Message Reaction Remove Triggers when the trigger content is removed from a message as a reaction. Message Create Triggers when a message is created (optionally in a channel). Member Join Triggers when a member joins your server. Member Leave Triggers when a member leaves your server. Restrictions Most triggers support role and channel restrictions. These allow you to prevent users with a role or in a channel from using your action or whitelist your action so only a group or channel can use your action. Sub-actions Sub actions are what the action does when it's triggered.

The levels plugin is now enabled in your server and can start being used immediately. Level Rewards If you wish to do so, you can set up role-rewards for users who reach certain level objectives. To do so, you must first create a role that you would like to award to your users. Then, click the Add Rewards button under the Rewards section of the levels plugin, select the level requirement drop-down menu and select the appropriate level threshold. Next, select the + icon and choose the appropriate role to assign. Now you're finished, but remember to save the changes you just made! A popup bar at the bottom of your screen will warn you that you have unsaved changes; click Save Changes to commit your changes. Level-Up Notifications Custom level-up notifications can be enabled, disabled, or edited under the Notification tab of the levels plugin. These notifications support tags as is shown by the default level-up message. You can also use the Embed Builder to create fancy customized messages.

The most basic usage is using tags as placeholders that are replaced when the tag is executed or sent. Some of the more advanced tags allow you to conditionally run tags, store persistent data or give a user roles. If you're new to tags, start out with some basics like {channel.name} . Using Tags Each tag comes with an example. You can evaluate the example input in your own server by doing a!tageval <input> . For example, to see what {channel.mention} would output in an action, you could evaluate it by doing a!tageval {channel.mention} . For examples that use tags like {args} , you may have to create a action to test them properly. Tag Errors Sometimes, tags return errors. These can be because of internal errors out of your control, or just because it's missing some arguments. You can get a full error message by evaluating the tag with a!tageval . If the tag errors out when being evaluated, it will give you details on the error. Handling errors Sometimes you may want to catch errors and display user-friendly messages instead of the default {tagname-ERRORn} . The {catch} tag can be used for just this. {catch} will return an error message when a child tag throws an error. You can use {throw} to purposefully throw an error and test it out. Example Input a!tageval {throw;Oh no, my command broke :c Output {throw-ERROR1} Input a!tageval {catch;{throw;Oh no, my command broke :c};Aw yis, I caught the error.} Output Aw yis, I caught the error.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"Tags/quick_start/#quick-start","text":"Tags are a powerful tool that Atlas uses.
