# Quick Start
Levels allow you to keep track of who is most active on your server by distributing experience points to everyone who sends messages in your server; the more active you are, the more XP you gain.

## Setting Up
The levels plugin is controlled by the [dashboard](https://atlasbot.xyz). Head over there, log into your server and choose the **Plugins** tab. Click on the **Levels** plugin and click "Enable" if prompted. The levels plugin is now enabled in your server and can start being used immediately.

## Level Rewards
If you wish to do so, you can set up role-rewards for users who reach certain level objectives. To do so, you must first create a role that you would like to award to your users. Then, click the **Add Rewards** button under the **Rewards** section of the levels plugin, select the level requirement drop-down menu and select the appropriate level threshold. Next, select the `+` icon and choose the appropriate role to assign.
Now you're finished, but remember to save the changes you just made! A popup bar at the bottom of your screen will warn you that you have unsaved changes; click **Save Changes** to commit your changes.

## Level-Up Notifications
Custom level-up notifications can be enabled, disabled, or edited under the **Notification** tab of the levels plugin. These notifications support [tags](/docs/Tags/) as is shown by the default level-up message. You can also use the [Embed Builder](https://atlasbot.xyz/embed-builder) to create fancy customized messages.

## Leaderboards
Atlas keeps track of who has the most XP and, therefore, who has the highest levels in your server. Anyone in your server can run the `a!leaderboard` command and view the current leaderboard. Alternatively, you can click on the **Leaderboard** button next on the levels plugin page.
