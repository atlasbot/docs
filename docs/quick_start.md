# Quick Start

Get Atlas up and running in a few super simple steps.

## Inviting Atlas

Before you can use Atlas, it must be invited to your server. Click [here](https://get-atlas.xyz/get) to go to Discord's authentication page. Select your server from the dropdown, then click Authorize. Atlas should show up as a member in your server, meaning you've successfully invited Atlas.

!!! note
    If your server doesn't show up in the dropdown, ensure you have administrator permissions in the server you want Atlas in.

## Running Commands

Atlas is controlled primarily by commands. To run a command, do `a!<command name>`. For example, to list all commands, type a message that says `a!help` and Atlas will direct-message you a list of commands.

# Configuring Atlas  

To configure Atlas, you'll probably want to use the dashboard. It's super simple and easy to use, and far better than commands.

* Go [here](https://get-atlas.xyz/dashboard/auth)
* Login to your Discord account if needed and click `Authorize`
    * Don't worry, Atlas won't be able to modify your account or use it in any way, this just allows us to verify who you are and see what guilds you share with Atlas.
* Once logged in, go to the top right and click "Servers", select your server from the list.

That's it! Once you're there, you can go into various modules and modify them however you'd like.
