# Quick Start

Get Atlas up and running in a few super simple steps.

!!! note
    Atlas is not a silver bullet, and getting Atlas won't magically solve all your problems. Filters work great, but are far from perfect. Fancy systems to keep track of who does what are always good, but you'll need someone to check them. If you want Atlas to solve all your problems, you've got the wrong bot.

## Inviting Atlas

Before you can use Atlas, it must be invited to your server. Click [here](https://get-atlas.xyz/get), thhen select your server from the dropdown and click Authorize. Once Discord has done it's magic, Atlas will show up as a member in your server, meaning you've successfully invited Atlas.

!!! tip
    You have to have administrator permissions in the target server to add Atlas, otherwise the server will not show up in the server list.

## Running Commands

Atlas is controlled primarily by commands. To run a command, do `a!<command name>`. For example, to list all commands, type a message that says `a!help` and Atlas will direct-message you a list of commands.

## Configuring Atlas  

To configure Atlas, you'll want to use the dashboard which you can access for free, assuming you have administrator permissions in the server you wish to modify.

* Go [here](https://get-atlas.xyz)
* Sign in by clicking "Sign In" at the top right, you'll be redirected where you might have to sign into your Discord account, then click "Authorise".
* Once logged in, go to the top right and click "Servers", select your server from the list.

That's it! Once you're there, you can go into various modules and modify them however you'd like.

!!! note
    Worried about your account? Don't worry. Atlas will only get basic read-only information about your account. Atlas will not be able to modify your account, send messages on your behalf or do anything harmful.
