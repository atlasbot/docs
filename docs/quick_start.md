# Quick Start Guide
New to using Atlas? Here is probably the best place to start!

## Invite Atlas
For Atlas to work in your server, you have to invite it. You can do so by clicking [here](https://atlasbot.xyz/get). Next, select your server from the drop-down menu and click **Authorize**. Discord may ask you to complete a captcha to prove you are a human, then it will show a confirmation screen if it was successful. Atlas will now show up as a member in your server, meaning you've successfully invited Atlas.

## Running Commands
Atlas is mainly controlled by user-operated text commands sent though your server's chat. By default, Atlas' command prefix is `a!`, so to execute a command type `a!<command name>`, without the arrows `< >`. For example, to get a list of all commands, type `a!help` and Atlas will direct-message you a list of commands.

## Accessing the Dashboard
Some features of Atlas, such as [actions](/Actions/quick_start/), cannot be configured via commands. This is why Atlas has a web dashboard to fine-tune control of your server. You can access the dashboard for your server by using the `a!dashboard` command in your server, or by clicking [here](https://atlasbot.xyz) and logging in manually.

!!! note
    You must be the server owner or have at least **Manage Server** permissions to access a server's dashboard. If you do not meet one of these criteria, you will not be able to access or edit the dashboard!
