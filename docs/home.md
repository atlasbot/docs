Welcome to the official documentation for **Atlas Version 8**. This resource is here to help you learn how to use Atlas and all its awesome features! We've tried to make everything as easy as possible to follow, so just sit back, relax, and let us do the explaining!

If you've never used Atlas before, you should probably take a look at our [quick start](/docs/quick_start.md/) guide. 

!!! note Atlas version 8 is a brand spankin' new update to the [Atlas bot](https://atlasbot.xyz/). These documents and the information found within may be incomplete or somewhat unclear. *Please give us some time to fix these mistakes.* 

## Open Source
If you're too impatient to wait for us to fix it or if you found something we missed, then lucky for you, this documentation is open source! Just head on over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/get-atlas/docs/) to suggest a revision.
