Welcome to the official documentation for **Atlas Version 8**. This resource site is here to help you learn how to use Atlas and all of it's awesome features! We've tried to make everything as easy as possible to follow, so just sit back, relax, and let us do the explaining!

If you've never used Atlas before, you should probably take a look at our [quick start](/quick_start) guide.

!!! note
Atlas version 8 is a brand spankin' new update to the [Atlas bot](https://atlasbot.xyz/) - that means that the documentation or information found within may be incomplete or somewhat unclear. _Please give us some time to fix these mistakes._

## Open Source

If you're too impatient to wait for us to fix it or if you found something we missed, then lucky for you, this documentation is open source! Just head on over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/atlasbot/docs/) to suggest a revision.

## Community Actions

Some members of the community have made a repository of custom commands that everyone is free to use and add to! You can check it out by [clicking here.](https://github.com/itsdoddsy/atlas-custom-commands)

!!! warning
This repository is recognised by the Atlas staff but does not officially belong to them (however it is run by some support staff). While every attempt is made to test commands and remove malicious material, moderation is not always possible. Use caution when using anything taken from this repository.
