Welcome to Atlas' Documentation. The aim here is to help you learn how to use Atlas, give you tips and make everything super simple for you to follow.

If you're new to using Atlas, you will probably want to check out the [quick start](/quick_start/) guide.

!!! note
    Atlas 8.0.0 is slowly being worked on, when it's released some variables may be changed or removed. It's advised that if you're using variables that you join our support server so you get notified when 8.0.0 is released and you can change your variables accordingly.
