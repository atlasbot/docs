# mention.channel <channel mention/id/name>

Mentions a channel. Uses fuzzy matching to find it based on what you input.

ℹ️ Note: Atlas will try and pick up regular user, channel and role mentions, so you shouldn't ever have to use this variable. Just tag whatever you're after regularly, for example `#channelname` and Atlas will convert it to a channel mention.

## Example

### Input

```json
{mention.channel;general}
```

### Output

```json
#general
```

## Supports

* [Custom commands](/Modules/custom_commands/)
* [Join and leave messages](/Modules/join_leave_messages/)
* [Level-up messages](/Modules/levels/)
