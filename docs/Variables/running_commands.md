# Running Commands

Each command has it's own variable. To run any command, do `{a!<command name}` as a variable. For example, to run `help` as a variable, you would enter `{a!help}`.

Arguments must be seperated via `;`, for example `{a!command;arg1;arg2}`, which would be the same as running `a!command arg1 arg2`

## Example

*Input*
```
{a!play;song;name}
```
*Output*

*idk how to show the output but it would return nothing and run the "ping" command as though the user did it*

## Supports

* [Custom commands](/Modules/Modules/custom_commands/)

* [Level-up messages](/Modules/levels/)
