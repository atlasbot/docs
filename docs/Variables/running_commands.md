# Running Commands

Each command has it's own variable. To run any command, do `{a!<command name}` as a variable. For example, to run `help` as a variable, you would enter `{a!help}`.

Arguments must be seperated via `;`, for example `{a!command;arg1;arg2}`, which would be the same as running `a!command arg1 arg2`

!!! warning
    Command variables do not support custom prefixes or aliases.
