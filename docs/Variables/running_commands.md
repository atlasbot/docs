# Running Commands

Each command has it's own variable. To run any command, do `{a!<command name}` as a variable. For example, to run `help` as a variable, you would enter `{a!help}`.

## Example

*Input*
```
{a!ping}
```
*Output*

*idk how to show the output but it would return nothing and run the "ping" command as though the user did it*

## Supports

* [Custom commands](/Modules/Modules/custom_commands/)
* [Join messages](/Modules/join_leave_messages/)
* [Level-up messages](/Modules/levels/)
