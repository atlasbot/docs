# giverole <role> [user]

Give a user a role from the server, pretty self explanatory. `[role]` can be a role name or ID, `<user>` is optional and can be a username, user id, nickname or mention. If `<user>` is not provided, it will use the user in context (for example, the person who ran the command that the variable is apart of).

## Example

### Input

```json
{giverole;Humans} You've been added to the Humans role.
```

### Output

```json
You've been added to the Humans role.
```

!!! note
    This would give the user the "Humans" role, then return nothing and say the sentence.
