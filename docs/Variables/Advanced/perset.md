# perset [key\] [value]

Sets a persistent key to a value. Essentially the same as "set" but it's persistent between commands.

!!! note
    Each guild gets one map that everything is thrown into. The map is only saved at the end of each command for performance reasons.

## Example

### Input

```json
{perset;test;wew} {perget;test}
```

### Output

```json
wew
```

## Supports

* [Custom commands](/Modules/custom_commands/)
* [Join and leave messages](/Modules/join_leave_messages/)
* [Level-up messages](/Modules/levels/)
